Qawwali music has a long and rich history that dates back to the 13th century, when it was created by the Indian composer and poet Amir Khusrow, who fused the Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and Indian musical traditions. Qawwali is a form of Sufi Islamic devotional singing that aims to lead the listeners to a state of religious ecstasy and spiritual union with Allah. Qawwali is performed by a group of male singers called qawwals, who sing poetic verses that express love, devotion, and longing for Allah and his Prophet Muhammad, as well as his family and companions. Qawwali is especially associated with the Chishti order of Sufism, which emphasizes the importance of music as a means of spiritual enlightenment.
 
One of the most important events in Islamic history that is commemorated through qawwali is the Battle of Karbala, which took place in 680 CE in present-day Iraq. In this battle, Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad and the leader of the Shia Muslims, was martyred along with his family and followers by the army of Yazid, the ruler of the Umayyad dynasty. Imam Hussain's sacrifice is seen as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and injustice, and his martyrdom is mourned by Muslims every year during the month of Muharram. Qawwali songs that narrate the tragic events of Karbala are called waqia (meaning \"incident\" or \"story\") and they aim to evoke the emotions of grief, sorrow, and admiration for Imam Hussain and his companions.
